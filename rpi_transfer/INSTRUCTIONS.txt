-----rpi-transfer Instructions:

---Quickstart:

-Adding:
Adding is as simple as creating the folders where the file resides,
and adding the file in there. For example, say I want to add a file to /home/pi
called test.txt.

I would create this directory tree:
_______________________SD card
____________rpi-transfer
________home
_____pi
_test.txt

Then, plug in the power, and the rpi-transfer program adds it into the correct
place! That's it!

-Overwriting
This is the same as adding. Any file will be overwritten.

-Editing
Editing can be achieved by adding the path of the file to edit into
EDIT-AND-DELETE.txt, prefixed by edit, as so:

edit /home/pi/test.txt

Then, plug in the power, boot up your OS, shut it down again, plug the SD card
back in, and you will find the file in the rpi-transfer folder, under the
correct path. Edit the file, and boot your OS up again, and it will be written.
That's it!

-Deleting
Deleting can be achieved by adding the path of the file to delete into
EDIT-AND-DELETE.txt, prefixed by del, as so:

del /home/pi/test.txt

Then, plug in the power, boot up your OS, and your file will be deleted! That's
it!
